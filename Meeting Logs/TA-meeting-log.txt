---------------------
Meeting Duration: 15 mins
During this meeting, our TA suggested that our login should be completed by the scheduled lab tomorrow 
in order to test it out properly. We also need release notes done before tomorrow so that we can receive
the proper grade. Other than that, we need more functionality to our design. We plan on discussing this further during lab and 
during our next meeting.
