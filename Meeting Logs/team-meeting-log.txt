----------------------
Meeting Duration: 1 hour
During this meeting, we discussed our wireframes and how we want to use API routes for our project.
We decided to use a weather API so that users can see the forecast in their area. However, we are not sure how
using this API would work, so we might change this our for using an API to check that someones email is valid. 
We also discussed the layout and the amount of pages we want in our website. We ultimately decided on a login/registration,
a home page where the user can begin finding matches, a connect page where the users can message each other, profile page, 
and weather page.

MEETING DATE: 4/18/23
----------------------
Meeting Duration: 45 minutes
During this meeting Nhat, Adam and Ainsley met to discuss backend. We decided that it might be incredibly difficult to store
images using postgres, so we are putting that idea on hold for now. In the meantime, we are working on the backend for the 
weather API, the matching, and the profile page. We have our main group meeting tomorrow.

MEETING DATE: 4/20/23

Meeting Duration: 50 minute
During this meeting we all met to discuss the changes and pushes that have been made, we found a couple bugs that need to be
 addressed uncluding the weather function, the profile page, and explore page. We made a schedule to work on the front end
 and "pretty up" the look. We plan on asking Nikita about our messaging function still have to make a plan to implement that.
 We plan on making 5 users to initialize the database and to build our explore page upon.
