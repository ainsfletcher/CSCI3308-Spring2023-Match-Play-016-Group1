Meeting Duration: 1 hour
During this meeting, we discussed our wireframes and how we want to use API routes for our project.
We decided to use a weather API so that users can see the forecast in their area. However, we are not sure how
using this API would work, so we might change this our for using an API to check that someones email is valid. 
We also discussed the layout and the amount of pages we want in our website. We ultimately decided on a login/registration,
a home page where the user can begin finding matches, a connect page where the users can message each other, profile page, 
and weather page.
